This is a 30-band vocoder implemented in openFrameworks using [Maximilian](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian) library.

### Implementation  
Shown in the diagram above, where the modulator is the original vocal (plus another pitched down voice just to have more low end), the carrier is a group of sqare waves, `n = 30`. The bandpass filters and the envelope followers are using classes in the Maximilian library.
